# Linear Regression: Study Hours vs. Percentage Scored

This project aims to predict the percentage score of a student based on the number of hours they studied. It utilizes linear regression, a popular machine learning algorithm, to establish a relationship between study hours and academic performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of two columns: "Hours" (number of hours studied) and "Scores" (percentage scored by the student). It contains information from various students, making it suitable for training a regression model.

## Project Workflow

1. Data Exploration: Start by analyzing the dataset to gain insights into the variables and their relationships. You can visualize the data using scatter plots, histograms, or correlation matrices to understand any patterns or trends.

2. Data Preparation: Preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for training the linear regression model. This step may involve handling missing values, checking for outliers, and scaling the features if necessary. Additionally, split the dataset into training and testing sets to assess the model's performance.

3. Model Training: Apply linear regression to the training data and fit the model. The algorithm will learn the underlying relationship between study hours and percentage scores based on the training data.

4. Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (R-squared). These metrics provide insights into how well the model predicts percentage scores based on study hours. A lower MSE and a higher R-squared value indicate a better-performing model.

5. Prediction: Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to make predictions on new data. Input the number of study hours, and the model will predict the corresponding percentage score.
